# OpenGateway: Decentralized AI Inference Network

## Vision

**OpenGateway** is a fully peer-to-peer, decentralized AI inference network that democratizes access to AI by enabling anyone to contribute compute resources and anyone to use AI for free.

### Core Principles

- **Contribute to Use**: Share your compute to earn AI usage - no free riders
- **Truly Decentralized**: No central servers - nodes communicate peer-to-peer
- **Community Powered**: Your gaming PC's idle time helps someone across the world, and theirs helps you
- **Geographic Intelligence**: Requests go local → nearest nodes → country nodes (they work hand in hand); the search keeps expanding and the request is distributed across that growing set until there is enough capacity to process it
- **Fair Exchange**: Usage credits proportional to contribution - not profit-driven

### The Value Proposition

**Contribute-to-Use Model:**
- Contribute your compute resources → Earn usage credits
- Use those credits to run AI inference
- No money required - just share your idle computing power
- The more you contribute, the more you can use

**For Contributors:**
- Exchange idle compute for AI access (not cash)
- Be part of democratizing AI infrastructure
- Community recognition and reputation
- Higher-resource contributions earn more credits

**Why This Works:**
- No free riders - everyone contributes
- Sustainable network growth
- Natural load balancing
- Community-driven, not profit-driven
- No gatekeepers, no vendor lock-in
- Privacy-conscious alternative to centralized providers
